# This module builds a dictionary (Dapp) containing commonly used applications.
# For your convenience, some applications have been added for you:
# 'w' opens Microsoft Word
# 'x' opens Microsoft Excel
# 'm' opens ArcMap
# 'c' opens ArcCatalog
# 'u' opens Microstation
# 
# Please note the use of 'r' in front of the file paths tells Python to 
# interpret backslashes as backslashes. Please also note that your
# application locations may vary
